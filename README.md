I am actually *VERY* keen on getting feedback and patches back, unfortunately these types of files don't make it easy, but I'm providing everything that I've got.  Beyond that, go forth and do awesome things.

These are optimized for printing on a Formlabs Form 1 printer (the one I have), but have been printed on FDM printers with the obvious resolution defects (though nothing structurally at issue).
